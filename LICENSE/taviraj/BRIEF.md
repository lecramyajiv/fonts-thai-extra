#Taviraj Font

The objective of this project is to create a formal Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface. Traviraj is a contemporary serif typeface family that maintains readability and legibility. Inspired by transitional serif typeface design, Traviraj has 9 weights and their italics, which range from Thin to black. It is a contemporary take on high contrast typefaces that never go out of style. For further development, this typeface can be extended the family to narrow and extended version, or matched with other non-latin script.
