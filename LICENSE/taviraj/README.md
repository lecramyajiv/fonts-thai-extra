# Taviraj Font

### [Specimen website at cadsondemak.github.io/taviraj](http://cadsondemak.github.io/taviraj/)

Taviraj is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensure readability and legibility. It is well-suited for formal usage. Thai letters have thick and thin stroke, as similar to Latin, together with its rounded and airy looped terminal. Taviraj was expanded into a 9 weight family including italic version. 

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to  take into consideration because it might lead to  confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so it is not proper to extend to so many weights since it might make all the details look obscure.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Ttfautohint supports Thai hinting process efficiently. It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended. For more information, visit http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

Taviraj is a word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. People also metaphorically refer Taviraj to the fall of dynasty and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation that Siam being threatened by France expansionism as his majesty expressing his sorrowful towards possibility of the end of his era. However, the fact that traditional Thai font is called "farangses" which means France, Taviraj is also in this genre, is full of contradictory per se and is worth discussing about its origin.

The Taviraj project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/taviraj
