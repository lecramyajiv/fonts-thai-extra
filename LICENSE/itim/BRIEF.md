#Itim Font

The objective of this project is to create a looped Thai and Latin handwriting typeface. Itim is a handwriting typeface that represents friendship and informality. The main idea is to make handwriting typeface that can be used in any informal context. The texture is filled with rounded and wavy strokes so you can get a perception of cute and clear human touch. Itim is developed with 3 stylistic set alternate glyph designs to reproduce human handwriting. This is a single weight typeface and ready to extend to other weight for further development.
