# Itim Font

Itim is how Thai people call "ice pop".

Itim is a Looped Thai and Latin Handwriting typeface that has a rounded tip marker stroke. With its fun and friendly style, Itim is suitable to use as headline and short body text in various type of works such as children's book, picture book, cooking book, and instructional media in school etc. It has 3 stylistic set alternate glyph designs and intelligent OpenType features to recreate the impression of handwriting with fun and friendly voice. It also has Latin 1 - 4 including Vietnam glyphs.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Looped Thai handwriting typefaces have slightly simplified details. Its strokes need to be managed carefully seeing that it has to be readable and portray natural handwriting.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.
