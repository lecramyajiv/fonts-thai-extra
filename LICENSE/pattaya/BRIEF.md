# Pattaya: A Thai Lobster Font

Lobster is one of the most popular web fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari. 
Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script. 
The objective of this project is to design Thai glyphs that are compatible with the Latin design. 
However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family.
